    "\n",
    " * E.g., follow a total order of the variables $\\{V_1,\\ldots,V_n\\}$.\n",
    " * A state assigns values to the first $k$ variables $\\{V_1,\\ldots,V_n\\}$\n",
    "   * Neighbors of node $\\{V_1 = v_1, \\ldots, V_k=v_k, V_{k+1}=x\\}$ for each $x \\in \\textrm{dom}(V_{k+1})$.\n",

    "The search space can be explored via DFS but evaluate each constraint as soon as all its variables are bound (all variables in a constrant, are in scope). Any partial assignment that doesn't satisfy the constraint can be pruned.\n",
    "\n",
    "A heuristic can be added to this algorithm. An order can be applied to the checking of the variables. It should start to check the variable that is used in the most constraints first (fail early)."

The constraint is that all variables have different values. The GT-algorithm runs with $O(ck^d)$ complexity, which gives us $O(1\\cdot 9^9)=387,420,489$ possible worlds. By the way the algorithm works, the first solution will be $\\{V_1=9, V_2=8,\\ldots,V_8=2,V_9=1\\}$, which is found halfway through all the worlds.
