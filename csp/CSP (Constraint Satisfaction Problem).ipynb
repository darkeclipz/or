    "\n",
    " * E.g., follow a total order of the variables $\\{V_1,\\ldots,V_n\\}$.\n",
    " * A state assigns values to the first $k$ variables $\\{V_1,\\ldots,V_n\\}$\n",
    "   * Neighbors of node $\\{V_1 = v_1, \\ldots, V_k=v_k, V_{k+1}=x\\}$ for each $x \\in \\textrm{dom}(V_{k+1})$.\n",

    "A heuristic can be added to this algorithm. An order can be applied to the checking of the variables. It should start to check the variable that is used in the most constraints first (fail early)."

The constraint is that all variables have different values. The GT-algorithm runs with $O(ck^d)$ complexity, which gives us $O(1\\cdot 9^9)=387,420,489$ possible worlds. By the way the algorithm works, the first solution will be $\\{V_1=9, V_2=8,\\ldots,V_8=2,V_9=1\\}$, which is found halfway through all the solutions.
